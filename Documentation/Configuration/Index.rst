=============
Configuration
=============

The Localizer will be configured using Localizer Settings Records only, so there is no TSconfig or other TypoScript you need to take care of and no plugin or static template to be included.

.. important::
    Since Localizer settings are tied to particular pages and their branches you need to create those records within a real page to get a ``pid`` value. The root page (0) wil not work.

To create one or more Localizers for your editors, just

#. Go to any real page and click on "Create New Record"
#. Within the group "Localizer for TYPO3" click on "Localizer Settings"
#. Fill in the necessary fields according to the instructions below
#. Save the records to make the new Localizer available for your editors

..  tip::
    If something went wrong while creating the record, you will find an error message in the "Last Communication Error" box and the record will be disabled.

After creating the records, make sure to add the necessary tasks to the Scheduler, so that the automatic workflow can be triggered via a cron job. Each of these tasks has to be recurring and should be set to a time that matches your usual workflow timing best.

   Scheduler Tasks

.. tip::
    To avoid performance problems during the import, only a single file will be imported during each scheduler run, so you should configure the time for the importer task accordingly to reduce the time your editors have to wait until each of their translation tasks has been imported..
